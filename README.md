# HamHelper

HamHelper (FKA HamCalc) is a versatile tool designed for amateur radio enthusiasts. It provides a range of calculations and utilities to assist with various aspects of ham radio operations.

Note that this application is very early stages, and functionality will be continue to be added. While I have preformed basic tests, there will likely be bugs. Please feel free to submit a PR fix or drop a descriptive report in Issues otherwise.

## Features

- **Frequency to Wavelength Conversion**: Easily convert between frequency and wavelength.
- **Ohm's Law Calculator**: Calculate voltage, current, resistance, and power using Ohm's Law.
- **Power Calculations**: Perform calculations related to peak voltage, PEP, RMS, and peak-to-peak voltage.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust window size, opacity, and other preferences.
- **Live Calculation**: Real-time updates of calculations as you input values.

## Installation

To use HamHelper, download the `freq.exe` executable file from the [releases page](https://github.com/joshpeterson1/HamCalc/releases). Double-click the file to run the application.

## Usage

Upon launching HamHelper, you'll be presented with a tabbed interface. Each tab contains fields for inputting values relevant to different calculations. Enter the required values, and the software will automatically calculate and display the results.
